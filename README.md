# Toy_Language
-project created during the third semester 
What I learned:
-how to use Git
-java basics
-java collections
-inheritance, interfaces in Java
-working with files in Java
-how to create an interpreter for my own language
-creating GUI with JavaFX and SceneBuilder

Description: This interpreter works based on hard-coded examples (no syntax analysis is done). It supports
variable declaration, arithmetic, logical and relational expressions, if and while statements, pointers, reading
and writing to a file, concurrent execution. 
Other things implemented:
-heap management
-type checking before the execution of the program
In the GUI you execute the examples steo by step and you can see what is happening in the background (similar to debug mode)
